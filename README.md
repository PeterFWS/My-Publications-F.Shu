# Brief description:

In this work, we present a comprehensive breakdown of mapping state of the art SLAM techniques into the agricultural domain, with particular emphasis on monocular SLAM. The paper received largely positive reviews and it could be a prototype for many applications of field robotics.

We hope this work can push the SLAM a little forward on very challenging scenario. If you are interested in our work, please feel free to contact us.
