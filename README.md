# Brief description:

In this work, we present a comprehensive breakdown of mapping state of the art SLAM techniques into the agricultural domain, with particular emphasis on monocular SLAM. The paper received largely positive reviews and should be very easy to reproduce.

We hope this work can push the SLAM a little forward on very challenging scenario. If you are interested in our work, feel free to contact us.
